            <h1>When Sushmita Sen was asked why she deserved to win and not Aishwarya Rai: 'I believe in two things...'</h1>
            <p>In 2005, Karan Johar had asked Sushmita Sen why did she think she deserved to win in Miss India 1994 pageant as compared to Aishwarya Rai, who was the first runner up. Here was her answer.Sushmita Sen and Aishwarya Rai had competed in the Miss India pageant in the same year, 1994, and went on to win Miss Universe and Miss World titles, respectively. During her appearance on Koffee With Karan in 2005, host Karan Johar had asked her if she thinks she deserved to win that night. The actor made it clear that she won not because she was “better” than Aishwarya, but because she was “the best” version of herself. She gave two reasons for why she won the Miss India pageant where Aishwarya was the first runner up.
